              <p class="card-text">The Bandra–Worli Sea Link (officially known as Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link) is a bridge that links Bandra in the Western Suburbs of Mumbai with Worli in South Mumbai. It is a cable-stayed bridge with pre-stressed concrete-steel viaducts on either side. It is a part of the proposed Western Freeway that will link the Western Suburbs to Nariman Point in Mumbai's main business district.The 1M bridge was commissioned by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), and built by the Hindustan Construction Company. The first four of the eight lanes of the bridge were opened to the public on 30 June 2009.All eight lanes were opened on 24 March 2010.
The sea-link reduces travel time between Bandra and Worli during peak hours from 20–30 minutes to 10 minutes. As of October 2009, BWSL had an average daily traffic of around 37,500 vehicles
